h1. Machinist Mongo

It aims to replace "machinist_mongomapper":http://github.com/yeastymobs/machinist_mongomapper to provide "Machinist":http://github.com/notahat/machinist adapters not just for "MongoMapper":http://mongomapper.com but for all the others MongoDB ORMs too. Right now it supports "Mongoid":http://mongoid.com and "MongoMapper":http://mongomapper.com, but we aim to support _all_ "mongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ ORMs, so If you're using something other than MongoMapper or Mongoid, please be sure to write a adapter for it.

h2. Usage

Using Machinist MongoMapper is simple. Put this in your @Gemfile@:

bc. gem 'machinist_mongo'

And run:

bc. bundle install

Or — if you’re using Rails 2.x — put this in @config/environment.rb@:

bc. config.gem 'machinist_mongo'

And run:

bc. rake gems:install

Now create your @spec/blueprints.rb@ or @test/blueprints.rb@ file as you normally would, only using "Mongoid":http://mongoid.com or "MongoMapper":http://mongomapper.com instead of ActiveRecord:

bc. require 'machinist/mongo_mapper' # or mongoid
require 'sham'

Don't forget to require the new @blueprints.rb@ file in your @spec_helper@ (or @test_helper@):

bc. require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/blueprints")

And you're all set. Be sure read "Machinist's README":http://github.com/notahat/machinist to find out how to create your objects and get this thing running.
